# Ephemeral Relationsips in Salmon Forecasting

This repository contains all data and R-language scripts needed to reproduce the 
analysis in _Ephemeral Relationships in Salmon Forecasting: a Cautionary Tale_ (Wainwright 2020, **Progress in Oceanography** XX:XXX-XXX).

The full analysis and detailed results for the publication are in the vignette
"EphemeralRelatinships.Rmd". Data and R scripts used in the vignette can 
be found in the subdirectories _Data_ and _R-scripts_, respectively.

To generate the analysis vignette in _Rstudio_, open the file
"EphemeralRelationships.Rmd" and click _Knit_. A number of R.packages may 
need to be installed first. Building the vignette may require additional 
system software, including _TeX_ and _pandoc_.
