Data in this folder need to be obtained and/or edited by hand.

OIMB pier (Charleston, OR) water temperature data are from Pete Lawson, NOAA. 
No longer collected, not sure if they are still available on the web. NO NEED
TO EDIT, just make sure it's there (WT.OIMB.daily.csv, WT.OIMB.mon.csv).

Spring Transition (SpringTrans.csv): only the Logerwell method is used here. 
Recent estimates should be availble in the annual PFMC salmon management 
"Preseason Report I" in the appendix table of OCN coho forecast data series.

Stoplight chart data: At present, downloadable as a CSV file from the NOAA 
Northwest Fisheries Science Center web site (www.nwfsc.noaa.gov), but no 
stable location on that site.

OCN Rivers Coho Salmon abundance: Updates available in the PFMC Preaseaon 
Report I, or from ODFW (at present, contact Mark Lewis or Erik Suring).

Buoy 46050 SST data: This is historic monthly data from the Stonewall Banks 
buoy, used to calibrate the OIMB pier temperatures. Only needs to have years 
2000 - 2009. NOTE that a newer, updated version of this file will be created 
in the Download directory.
